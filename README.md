# Blokko DeFi Dashboard: The Master Blueprint

## 1. The Grand Vision: The "Plaid for Web3"

Blokko is building the foundational infrastructure for global stablecoin commerce. Our mission is to become the **"Plaid for Web3"**â€”a universal aggregator and conversion engine that seamlessly connects all forms of digital currency.

This application, the **Blokko DeFi Dashboard**, is an exclusive, private Web3 application for Blokko merchants. It serves two primary purposes:
1.  **The Ultimate Treasury Tool:** Empower merchants to not just accept stablecoins, but to put them to work automatically, securely, and intelligently through an on-chain Investment DAO.
2.  **The Foundational Prototype:** Serve as the technical and conceptual foundation for the broader Blokko ecosystem, including a universal wallet and a global stablecoin converter.

## 2. Current Project Status: Fully-Featured Prototype

This repository contains a comprehensive, fully-featured prototype that brings the Blokko vision to life. It is built on a clean, stable, and runnable monorepo foundation.

### Key Implemented Features:

*   **Immersive Visual Foundation & UI Shell:**
    *   **Professional Branding:** A polished and professional UI built with a custom Chakra UI theme that reflects the Blokko brand identity.
    *   **Intuitive Layout:** A fixed header and navigation structure provide a seamless and intuitive user experience across all pages.

*   **The Intelligent DeFi Engine:**
    *   **Intelligent DEX Aggregator:** The "Swap" page features a backend API that queries multiple DEXs (simulated) to aggregate quotes and identify the best possible rate for a given trade.
    *   **On-Chain Investment DAO (UI & Interfaces):**
        *   The smart contract interfaces (`IBlokkoVault.sol`, `IAdapter.sol`) for the core DeFi engine have been defined.
        *   The "Allocation" page provides a UI for merchants to set their desired investment strategy across different DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound), which integrates with the `IBlokkoVault` smart contract interface.

*   **The AI Superstructure & User Ecosystem:**
    *   **"QuickBooks-Level" AI Tax Accountant (Prototype):** The application features a "Tax Center" where users can input transactions, and a backend API endpoint calculates capital gains using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. The UI then presents this information in a mock tax report, simulating Form 8949.
    *   **Blokko AI Agents & Academy:** The UI for these critical ecosystem pillars has been created with placeholder content, establishing their place in the application and paving the way for future development.

## 3. Future Development Roadmap

This prototype is the first step in a broader journey. The following is a clear roadmap for future development:

*   **Phase 1: Full Smart Contract Implementation & Deployment:**
    *   **Task:** Build out the complete Solidity logic for the `BlokkoVault` and multiple `Adapter` contracts (e.g., Aave, Compound).
    *   **Goal:** Move from interfaces to fully functional, audited, and deployed smart contracts on a testnet.

*   **Phase 2: Real-Time Data Integration:**
    *   **Task:** Integrate an on-chain data provider (e.g., The Graph, Dune Analytics) to replace mock data with real-time portfolio tracking, transaction history, and yield data.
    *   **Goal:** Provide merchants with a live, accurate, and transparent view of their treasury performance.

*   **Phase 3: The Universal Wallet & "One-Scan" QR Code Flow:**
    *   **Task:** Design and build the UI/UX for the customer-facing "One-Scan" QR code payment flow. This involves creating the interface for a wallet that can aggregate multiple funding sources.
    *   **Goal:** Create a frictionless payment experience that abstracts away the complexity of the underlying blockchain technology.

*   **Phase 4: Deepen AI Capabilities:**
    *   **Task:** Train the AI Accountant on real tax law for major jurisdictions and integrate with a powerful LLM. Plan and build API integrations with traditional accounting software like QuickBooks and Xero.
    *   **Goal:** Transform the AI Accountant from a prototype into an indispensable tool for financial reporting and compliance.

## 4. Getting Started: How to Run This Prototype

### System Requirements
*   Node.js (v18 or higher)
*   npm

### Installation
All dependencies for the monorepo (root, frontend, and backend) can be installed with a single command from the project's root directory:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

### Running the Application
To run the application, you only need to run one command from the project's root directory. This will start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.
```bash
npm run dev
```
*   The **backend server** will run on `http://localhost:3001`.
*   The **frontend development server** will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

You can now open your web browser and navigate to **`http://localhost:5173`** to view and interact with the Blokko DeFi Dashboard prototype.
